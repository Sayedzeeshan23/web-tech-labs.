# Lab 01 Reflection

During this lab, I learned how to use Git to manage my projects effectively. I created new files, added them to the repository, and practiced committing and pushing changes to GitHub. I also learned how to work with branches, make experimental changes, and merge them back into the main branch. This helped me understand how to isolate features and track changes efficiently. Overall, this lab improved my confidence in using Git for version control and project organization.
